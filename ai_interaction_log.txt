AI Tool(s) Used:
- ChatGPT

What I used it for:
- Debugging small issues while wiring up Express + routers
- Fixing API filtering and client-side rendering bugs
- Quick checks on status codes / required responses for the rubric

Specific prompts/questions I asked (at least 3):
- "Why is npm saying Missing script: dev?"
- "It says Cannot find module './routes/pageRouter' — what did I name wrong?"
- "My /api/projects is returning [] — what should I check first?"
- "Why does the Projects page stay on 'Loading projects...'?"

What I changed after receiving the AI output (my own decisions):
- Added the correct npm scripts and fixed a folder/require path mismatch for the routers.
- Corrected my projects data filtering so the list endpoint only returns active projects.
- Fixed small JS rendering issues so project cards and the details view show properly (including images).
- Did my own testing in the browser to confirm all routes work and error cases show correctly.
